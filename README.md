# Autopilot: Your PC's Personal Assistant ü§ñ

Autopilot is on a mission to fully automate your PC experience. Imagine giving your computer a high-level command like "Create a vacation itinerary for Rome" or "Clean up my downloads folder," and Autopilot takes care of the rest, directly controlling your keyboard, mouse, and executing commands.



## Phase 1: LLM-Powered Command Execution ‚úÖ

The first phase of Autopilot is complete! Here's what we've achieved:

* **Direct PC Control:** Autopilot seamlessly interacts with your keyboard and mouse, mimicking human input.
* **LLM-Driven Execution:** A powerful Large Language Model (LLM) interprets your commands and translates them into actions on your PC.
* **Easy Task Handling:** Autopilot can already handle a variety of tasks, from web searches and document creation to basic system maintenance.

## What's Next? Phase 2 and Beyond üöÄ

Phase 2 is where Autopilot gets even smarter:

* **Multiple Agents:** We'll introduce specialized agents to handle complex tasks that require domain-specific knowledge.
* **Action Verification:**  Autopilot will learn to double-check its work, ensuring accuracy and preventing unintended consequences.
* **Enhanced Task Range:**  Expect Autopilot to tackle even more challenging commands, from data analysis to creative projects.

## Installation & Setup (Phase 1) üõ†Ô∏è

**Prerequisites:**

* Python
* OpenAI API keys
